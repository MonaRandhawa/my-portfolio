After doing research, we decided to create a Montesorri inspired flip card game that would allow children to build visual memory, concentration, and improve their ability to find similarities and differences between objects. For our theme, we opted for bright and vibrant colours that appealed to a younger audience. We created preselected categories such as Animals, Shapes, Letters and Colours, and also included a custom category that allowed parents to upload their own images or photos that appealed to their children. ",projectDescriptionSolution:"While working on this project, I brainstormed different ideas on where to display our parent dashboard. One of the challenges we faced was trying to figure out the flow of our application and how to give children the opportunity to play with preselected categories without having to wait for a parent to upload photos. I decided to add a \u201cplay\u201d button on our homepage so that children could be directed to the main play page without needing to login. If the children wanted to play with custom images, their parent\u2019s would need to login and upload images through the parent dashboard. We settled on this option because we did not want to allow children access to the photo uploading capabilities. As this game was meant to be played on a desktop or tablet, we did not want children to accidentally upload sensitive information that might be stored on their parent\u2019s devices (i.e. pictures of a passport, or tax return). Another portion of the game that I worked on was the game logic. Using JavaScript and React state hooks, I created functions that evaluated when two cards had been flipped, if they were match, and which cards were \u201csolved\u201d.

With the current setup, vistors don't have access to this information and are often left idling, circling around, or stalled in traffic.",projectDescriptionSolution:"We created a web based application with two interfaces; one for visitors to the area and the another for ground parking attendants who would be able to update the number of stalls available in real time. For this project, I worked on the interface which was accessed by our end users. Keeping in mind that visitors would access this website through their smartphones, I created a mobile responsive design with a clean interface.
